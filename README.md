This is the official repository for 📃[Distill Visual Chart Reasoning Ability from LLMs to MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18798).

You have two options to obtain our dataset:

1. Download directly from the 🤗**HuggingFace** Datasets: [hewei2001/ReachQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hewei2001/ReachQA).
2. Clone this repository and **generate 📊charts using the synthetic code**: The process takes about **3 minutes**!

## 📖Introduction

### 🔮Code-as-Intermediary Translation

We propose **Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT)**, a cost-effective, efficient and easily scalable data synthesis method for distilling visual reasoning abilities **from LLMs to MLLMs**.  The code serves as an intermediary that translates visual chart representations into textual representations, enabling LLMs to understand cross-modal information. Specifically, we employ text-based synthesizing techniques to construct chart-plotting code and produce **ReachQA**, a dataset containing 3k **rea**soning-intensive **ch**arts and 20k Q&A pairs to enhance both recognition and reasoning abilities.  Experiments show that when fine-tuned with our data, models not only perform well on chart-related benchmarks, but also demonstrate improved multimodal reasoning abilities on general mathematical benchmarks such as MathVista.

> Figure: Overview of the CIT method for synthesizing multimodal instruction data. The process begins with **33 seed codes** and generates plot codes across various chart types, topics, and complexity levels through the Self-Instruct and Evol-Instruct stages. The chart set and instruction set are constructed bi-directionally, and the final filtered data yields ReachQA, a dataset for distilling visual chart reasoning abilities from LLMs to MLLMs.

### 📈ReachQA

Abbreviations: Vis.=visual, Comp.=complexity, Temp.=template, Refer.=Reference, Reas.=reasoning, Rat.=rationale, Annot.=annotation and Scal.=scalable.

## ⏩️Quick Start

1. **Obtain ReachQA dataset in 3 minutes:**

```bash
cd ReachQA
conda activate ReachQA_data

python ./data/reachqa_train/execute_code.py \
	--code_dir ./data/reachqa_train/code/ \
	--image_dir ./data/reachqa_train/images/ 
	
python ./data/reachqa_test/execute_code.py 
	--code_dir ./data/reachqa_test/code/ \
	--image_dir ./data/reachqa_test/images/ 
```

2. **Data Construction with CIT:**

Before generating, the parameters in the `scripts/` should be modified!

```bash
cd ReachQA
conda activate ReachQA_data

# Generate code
bash ./scripts/data/run_openai_generate_code.sh

# Execute code and generate images
python ./data/reachqa_train/execute_code.py \
	--code_dir ./data/reachqa_train/all_code/ \
	--image_dir ./data/reachqa_train/all_images/ 

# Filter images
bash ./scripts/filter/run_rating_images.sh
python ./data/reachqa_train/filter_rated_image.py \
	--data_dir ./data/reachqa_train/

# Generate QA
bash ./scripts/data/run_openai_generate_QA.sh

# Filter QA
bash ./scripts/filter/run_rating_QA.sh
python ./data/reachqa_train/filter_rated_QA.py \
	--data_dir ./data/reachqa_train/
```

3. **Training / Inference / Evaluation:**

Before training, the JSON instruction file needs to be processed into **Swift format**!

For the specific format, refer to the [Official Swift Documentation](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift/tree/main).
```bash
cd ReachQA
conda activate ReachQA_train

# Swift format
cd ./data/reachqa_train/
python process_to_swift_internvl.py

# Training
cd ../..
bash ./scripts/train/internvl2_lora.sh

# Inference
bash ./scripts/eval/infer_InternVL2-8B.sh

# Evaluation
bash ./scripts/eval/run_openai_evaluation.sh
```
## 🌟Main Results

> Table: Evaluation results on seven benchmarks. Details for these benchmarks and models are presented in § 4.1. The best performance for each category and task is in **bold**. The percentage of performance improvements compared to the vanilla model is denoted by (↑).

> Figure: An example of **attention visualization** from the ChartQA dataset. The top row shows the results from the vanilla LLaVA-Next-Llama3-8B model, while the bottom row displays the results from our fine-tuned model. For each output, we present the attention distribution (highlighted zones) at **three key steps**, calculated by averaging the attention values of all tokens in each step.
