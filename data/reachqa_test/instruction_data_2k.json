First, the coral cover score in this region is 85, the highest among the regions, indicating good coral growth conditions. Second, the biodiversity score is 90, also the highest, which means the region has a rich variety of species and high ecosystem stability. Lastly, the water clarity score is 80, which, although not the highest, is still relatively high and contributes to sunlight penetration, promoting coral photosynthesis. The combined effect of these three factors results in the best overall health condition of coral reefs in the Pacific Ocean region."
